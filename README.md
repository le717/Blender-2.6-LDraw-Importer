==========================

A [Blender 2.6](http://www.blender.org) Importer script for the [LDraw System of Tools's Brick Library.](http://www.ldraw.org)

> LDraw&trade; is an open standard for LEGO CAD programs that allow the user to create virtual LEGO models and scenes. You can use it to document models
> you have physically built, create building instructions just like LEGO, render 3D photo realistic images of your virtual models and even make animations.
> The possibilities are endless. Unlike real LEGO bricks where you are limited by the number of parts and colors, in LDraw nothing is impossible.
