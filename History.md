History Lesson
==============

Hi everybody, Triangle717 here, maintainer of **Blender 2.6 LDraw Importer**.
It looks like you have come for the history of this project, and you are in the right place for that. :smiley:

There are many LDraw importer scripts available for Blender 2.3, each one with its own errors and quirks, with some being lost over time due to dead links.
Many people have wanted an updated version of these scripts for a while, but nobody seemed to want to write one.

However, David Pluntze did and [posted it](http://projects.blender.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=30327&group_id=153&atid=467) in the Blender Tracker on February 23, 2012.
The script was written for Blender 2.5, was in poor shape, and was highly incomplete. By the time I found it in early October 2012,
Blender 2.6 _had been_ released, and the script was not even usable due to changes made in the Python API.
I contacted my friend and Python programmer [@JrMasterModelBuilder](https://github.com/JrMasterModelBuilder) who corrected the script
and allowed it to be used in Blender 2.6.

From then on until January 2013, he and I tried to improve the script as much as possible.
Many versions were released after that, with various bugs fixed and identified.
Since I knew very little Python code at the time, the process was challenging, to put it simply.

After putting off open-sourcing the script for anyone to improve, I finally uploaded it here on GitHub.
Since then, people have been kind enough to support the project by submitting patches and starring it,
whichs gives me motivation to continue making **Blender 2.6 LDraw Importer** the best available LDraw script for Blender.

The End.
